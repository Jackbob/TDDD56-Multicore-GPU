1a) QUESTION: How many cores will simple.cu use, max, as written? How many SMs?

    It creates 1 block of 16 threads to be ecexuted in paralell. So 16 at most.

1b) QUESTION: Is the calculated square root identical to what the CPU calculates? Should we assume that this is always the case?

    Yes, in broad terms. There will however always be floating point errors 
    that might differentiate from the CPU floating point errors.

2a) QUESTION: How do you calculate the index in the array, using 2-dimensional blocks?

    int row = (blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y);
	int col = (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x);
	int e_per_row = (gridDim.x*blockDim.x);
	int idx = row*e_per_row + col;
